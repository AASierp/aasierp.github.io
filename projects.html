                <p class = "p1">
                    Developed as an ASP.net MVC application using C#/.NET framework, Entity Framework Core, SQLite, and HTML Agility Pack to aggregate real estate listing data through web scraping techniques. The application collects and organizes property information, including prices, addresses, descriptions and original listing URLs. The information is then stored in a local database and accessed and filtered through a web application.

                <p class="p1">
                    I developed this application for a very specific use case. To filter employee time records and return any entries in which an employee was late clocking-in or late returning from break/lunch. 
                    It was built using C#/.NET with WinForms and the ClosedXML library for excel file manipulation.
                    It allows the user to load an excel file and display the contents in a grid-view window. It can then be filtered based a built-in set of predetermined criteria.
                    When filtered, it will return any incidents of "tardiness" to the grid-view. The user can then save the filtered data do a new excel file as output.

                <p class ="p1">
                    This is a business website for Bad Rabbit Beard Balm. It will eventually be a fully functioning e-commerce site.
                    So far, it has been constructed solely with html and css. But will eventually be made more robust and dynamic with vanilla javascript on 
                    the front end and Node.js on the backend to handle user authentication/authorization and order/payment processing.

                <p class = "p1">
                    This project represents my first foray into programming in early 2023.
                    This is a simple text based adventure game written in Python. I also used Tkinter to build the GUI. 
                    This is my first attempt at a solo project using what little python knowledge I had acquired so far. I know the code is probably very weak and riddled with errors. 
                    However, for all its failings, it has taught me a great deal about the python fundamentals, how to utilize the Tkinter library and even forced me to deal with a few bugs along the way. 
                    The issue of "circular import", in particular, gave me a lot of trouble. While I didn't pursue python much beyond this point, opting for C#/.Net instead, I think it is interesting
                    to see what someone can do with a few weeks of self study.
